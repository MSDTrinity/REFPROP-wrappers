This REFPROP wrapper for CVI/LabWindows was written in version 17.0.0

It is intended only to demonstrate basic setup and calling from the DLL. Additional functions can be implemented by the end user once basic communication with the DLL has been verified, using the REFPROP Documentation pdf provided with the REFPROP DLL.

A copy of the REFPROP DLL, and the REFPROP_lib.h file will need to be added to the 
``C:/Program Files (x86)/REFPROP/``
folder or an alternate location if specified in ``REFPROP_Main.c`` before this example will work.
